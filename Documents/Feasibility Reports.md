# Feasibility Reports

#### Purpose
A feasibility report is an analysis on how successfully a project can be completed. In this study, economic, legal, technological and scheduling factors would need to be addressed to ensure if the project is feasible overall. These studies are used by the project managers to determine the outcomes of said project before deciding whether that the project should be invested in or not. Feasibility studies also help with risk assessment as it allows for problems to be identified and solutions that could alleviate them, and can lead towards marketing strategies to help with the overall investment of the product.

#### Components
The components within a feasibility study are as followed:
Description of the product, with the layout and the deliverables
Market feasibility, describing the industry, market protentional, highlighting competitors and sales estimations.
Technical feasibility, with details on deliverables and how they would be delivered.
Financial feasibility, a plan on the amount of funding for the product, the sources of capital and return on the investment.
Organizational feasibility, a structure of the project including management and the resources for that project.

#### Impact of feasibility

Technical feasibility is used to provide details on deliverables and what will be delivered. The deliverables may be either be shown as too ambitious or too lacking, they may be fine when described on the study but if the deliverables underachieve or need to be fixed. The clientâ€™s expectations of what could be could cause a lack of interest should the project be delivered with lacklustre deliverables. For example, a user interface should be upgraded onto a newer system.

Economic feasibility is the cost and time given to that project. The cost is more of an estimate rather than an exact amount, so throughout the project, there could be risks of the project delay or extended deadline, cutbacks, etc. and the overall project could be effected much to the dismay of the project manager. The project could effectively be altered to fit the newer resources and costs.

Organisational Feasibility is the structure of the project that highlights on management of the project and the resources. The factors involved such as the skill of the development team could impact the overall design of the project or what resources are involved could change the perception of the project and this could change on how the project will be designed.
